What is JavaScript?


JavaScript is a high-level programming language primarily used for creating dynamic and interactive content on web pages. Originally developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995, JavaScript has since become one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web alongside HTML and CSS.

JavaScript allows developers to add interactivity to websites by enabling features such as animations, form validation, dynamic content updates, and much more. It is widely supported by modern web browsers and can be used both on the client-side (in the browser) and server-side (with platforms like Node.js).

Over the years, JavaScript has evolved significantly, with new features and standards being added to the language. Today, it is used not only for web development but also for building server-side applications, mobile apps, desktop applications, and even in IoT (Internet of Things) development.



• What is the use of isNaN function?


The `isNaN()` function in JavaScript is used to determine whether a value is "Not-a-Number" (NaN) or not. This function returns `true` if the value passed to it is NaN, and `false` if the value is a valid number or can be converted into one.

```javascript
isNaN(123);      // false, 123 is a number
isNaN('Hello');  // true, 'Hello' cannot be converted into a number
isNaN('123');    // false, '123' can be converted into the number 123
isNaN(NaN);      // true, NaN is "Not-a-Number"
```

It's often used to validate input, especially when dealing with user input where you expect numeric values, but need to handle cases where non-numeric values might be entered.
